Hello, Folks! It's been a while ðŸ‘€

I'm back with a straightforward tutorial that guides you through building a simple application using Supabase on the backend and Next JS on the front end. This tutorial aims to help you grasp the process of easily writing and retrieving data from a database.

## Technologies Used:
- Next JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase

## What are we building?
We're creating a collaborative storytelling application. In this app, anyone can contribute a new story or edit an existing one. The basic functionality includes adding a story, which in turn adds new data to the database, and editing an existing story, which updates any relevant preexisting data.

Here's the application: storycreator-app.vercel.app
